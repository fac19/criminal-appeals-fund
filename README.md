## Our project

This is a platform for barristers to access funding so they are able to appeal unsuccessful legal cases.

The best way to navigate this project once you've run `npm install` (and got our secret login details for Netlify :shushing_face:) is to do the following:

- log in to Netlify with our account details
- `netlify login` from the terminal in the project root
- `netlify dev` will build and run a local server with the Netlify environment (i.e. where the Airtable secret key is :shushing_face:)

We also have a [style guide](https://github.com/fac19/criminal-appeals-fund/issues/27).

## Tech stack

This site is built with React utilising the following libraries:

- react-router
- Material UI
- styled-components

It is deployed on Netlify and the build environment comprises

- ESLint, Prettier and Husky
- CodeCov and Travis
- Lambda functions

Data is stored on [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) and content on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

Our Airtable schema looks something like:

Where users are assigned IDs generated by Airtable, and which is stored with useContext and sent when uploading applications. Applications are automatically given a stage of 1, here are the stages:

**1 Upload**
Applicant uploads application

**2 Criteria met**
PO indicates application meets criteria

**3 Success**
PO agrees to fund application

**4 Invoice**
Applicant sends invoice

**5 Successful close**
PO arranges payment

**6 Unsuccessful close**
PO does not fund application

**7 Withdrawn**
Applicant withdraws application

### API docs

[Here are some beautifully automated API docs](https://airtable.com/app7xH8ItDsTvcPhg/api/docs#curl/introduction) which you can't use because you don't know our secret :shushing_face:

---

## Learnings

- Airtable IDs are far too clever and their docs are sneaky
- Cloudinary allows access to uploaded PDFs on literally a case by case basis
- Lambda functions are helpful and stressful
- Context can make State available Anywhere
- Having two versions of Webpack regularly breaks everything
- Material UI has a very narrow range usefulness over styled components (i.e. our beautiful stepper)

---

## What next

- Airtable UI for PO
- Finishing API routes to database
- Accessing PDFs
- Ensuring we/PO can update application stages
- Styling for finished MVP
- PO handover
